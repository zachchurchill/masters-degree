# Homework 3

## Recursive compare

Write a **recursive** method that compares two strings.
It should return true if the strings are equal,
and false otherwise.

## Compare Reversed

Write a **recursive** method that checks whether one string is the reverse of another.

## String Generator

Write a recursive method that generates a list of all possible character strings of a given length for a given numeric base.
For example,
generating all base 2 strings of length 3 should yield [000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111].
Generating all base 4 strings of length 2 should yield [00, 01, 02, 03, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 21, 22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 33].
You should not use any of the built-in Java functions that convert between number bases.
Build the strings using the recursive structure of your code.
