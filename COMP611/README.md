# COMP 611 - Advanced Data Structures and Programming

*From syllabus:*

## Course Description

This course covers key knowledge and skills for advanced software development using the object-oriented approach.
The student learns,
manipulates and reflects on nonlinear data structures such as trees and heaps.
Recursive algorithms,
sorting algorithms,
algorithm efficiency,
and advanced design patterns are addressed.
To support the advanced concepts and principles of software development,
the student will design,
code,
test,
debug,
and document programs with increased scale and complexity using industry's best practices (such as GitHub) and the Java programming language.

## Course Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you should be able to do the following:

1. Analyze real-world problems with advanced object-oriented analysis principles and design patterns.
2. Analyze, manipulate, and apply non-linear data structures.
3. Analyze, compare, contrast, and execute sorting algorithms.
4. Design, code, analyze, and trace recursive algorithms and data structures.
5. Design, develop, and manage software projects with increased scale and complexity with industry's best practices, such as GitHub.
