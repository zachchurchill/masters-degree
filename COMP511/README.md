# COMP 511 - Foundations of Data Structures & Object-Oriented Design

*From syllabus:*

## Course Description

This course continues the object-oriented approach to intermediate-level software development.
The student will learn and reflect on fundamental object-oriented analysis techniques,
basic design patterns,
and linear data structures such as lists and queues.

## Course Outcomes

Upon successful complete of this course, you should be able to do the following:
1. Analyze real-world problems with object-oriented principles of inheritance and polymorphism.
2. Design, implement, and test solutions based on object-orient principles of inheritance and polymorphism.
3. Detect and correct runtime program errors using exceptions.
4. Analyze, code, and execute linear data structures.
5. Analyze, compare, contrast, and apply basic design patterns.
