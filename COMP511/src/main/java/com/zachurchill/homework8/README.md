# Week 8 Homework

## Singly Linked Lists

Consider the singly-linked list as defined in the starter code below,
which is similar,
yet different from the LinkedCollection implemented in the videos.
Write code that will implement the methods get(int index),
set(int index, E value),
indexOf(E element, int start),
lastIndexOf(E element, int end),
and slice(int start, int end) according to the specifications given in the starter code comments.
An implementation of toString() for SinglyLinkedList is provided to help you debug.

You may add any additional helper methods you desire,
including constructors.
However,
do not touch the existing method signatures.
