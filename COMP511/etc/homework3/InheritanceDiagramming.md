# Inheritance Diagramming

Consider the following statement and answer the following questions.

> A superclass Account has a customer name and an account number. A subclass of
Account called SavingsAcount has a balance. Another subclass of Account called
CreditCard has a balance and a credit limit. Getters and setters exist for all
fields (except balance, which only has a getter) as well as a toString() method.
Credit cards have a charge() and refund() method while savings accounts have
deposit() and withdraw() methods -- all of which take an amount as a parameter.
